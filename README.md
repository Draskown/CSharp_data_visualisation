# Backup 1

This branch consists of projects that were the last stable before any significant changes that have been made.

Currently the projects are at following stages.

CPDT_1:

- Everything's done except of the tracks of the objects.
- The tracks are calculated with finding the closest object to the current centroid.
- But they consist only of 2 centroids so it needs some work. 

DVT_1:

- Done.

DVT_2:

- Everything's done except of moving the bitmap (2D as well as 3D)
