# CSharp data collection and visualisation projects

These projects were given to me in the university and are only for educational purposes.

## Data collection

Projects with a prefix `CPDT` are the ones that were created for collecting different kinds of data (mostly from a LIDAR) and performing manipulations with it such as segmentation, logging, etc.

- [CPDT_LR1](./CPDT_LR1/) collects data from a 2D LIDAR and performs segnemtation using.
- [CPDT_LR2](./CPDT_LR2/) is the same as [CPDT_LR1](./CPDT_LR1/), but with a 3D LIDAR and more complex.
- [CPDT_LR3](./CPDT_LR3/) collects, parses, visualises and logs messages between CAN modules with specific addresses.
- [CPDT_LR4](./CPDT_LR4/) 

## Data visualisation

Projects with a prefix `DVT` were created for data and statistics visualisation, mainly it would be points cloud, histograms, etc.
